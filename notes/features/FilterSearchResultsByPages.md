When searching, be able to filter the blocks returned to only be blocks that are on specific pages or are children blocks of blocks with page references.

I want to be able to select an array of pages to scope the search for. When doing this, it would probably be nice to have a list of related pages to select.

in the search result the list of notes connected to the result we can right click that and open in the right panel a search result scoped to that note.
